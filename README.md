# Supplementary Learning Materials for BEng Computer Engineering Programme

This repository is a collection of supplementary learning materials for the **BEng Computer Engineering Programme** at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**. The materials include notes and cheatsheets for various courses, primarily edited by myself and other students. Any materials sourced from the internet will be indicated in the description.

As a **Year 2 student** in the programme, I cannot ensure the correctness of all details, especially for courses taken a while ago. If you spot any mistakes in the materials, please contact me via email: [e1121656@u.nus.edu](mailto:e1121656@u.nus.edu).

Additionally, I am pursuing a **second major in Mathematics**, so you will also find materials for some Math courses.

### Update 24 July 2024:
- **CS1010 PE Prep**
- **CG2111A Revision Notes**
- **GEA1000 Cheatsheet** (edited from internet resources)
